## Week 1 


### Context

<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;<strong>The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World</strong></p>
<p>1.<strong>&nbsp;Summary:</strong> The Internet of Things discussed the architecture of our society's dependency on the internet. .</p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong>&quot;The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it&apos;s not really yours&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Important Thing:</strong> &quot;There are no clear and agreed-upon architectures for building connected systems.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>4. &nbsp;Comment:</strong> I didn&apos;t really think about how different architectures can effect the systems</p>
<p><strong>5. Question:</strong> What are the essential elements for creating a test bed?</p>
<p><br></p>

## Week 2

<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> In the article the main topic is our dependency on technology. Examples such as alarm systems, dog doors and many more are given in the question of what would we do if the WiFi no longer existed. Therefore the article suggests that we must create aiding technology that supports us, but also that we are not completely dependent on</p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:&nbsp;</strong>&quot;Well, for one, it means things are less reliable. More than once i&apos;ve come home to an icy house because the internet had gone down, then spent hours trying to fix it only to have the thermostat jammed on 86 degrees until tech support reset my account. My old devices were so dumb, but in hindsight, that was kind of charming. They didn&apos;t do much, and perhaps that simplicity is really what we need.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I sometimes think about this and how reliable we are on technology. I think this can also be expanded to beyond technology. This weekend my mom and I had a discussion on how reliant we are to having fully stocked grocceries and gas supply. How we as humans are completely dependent on something else more than we are dependent on ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>4. Question:&nbsp;</strong>How do we create evolving devices that we can still benefit from, but are not completely dependent on? How does these ideas expand into crypto currency?</p>
<p><strong>5. Summarize:</strong> When creating new devices the 2 articles suggest that we need to be more precaution when constructing around reliability. More specifically we need to make sure there is agreement between systems. As well as its important to develop systems to reflect architectural choices. Lastly, we should create a test bed to make sure we are not too reliable on these new product.</p>

## Week 3

<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;<strong>"Artist Profile: Julian Oliver"</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot;</p> "This discusses the secretive reputation of the internet </p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot;Engineering, not Art, is the most, is the most transformative language.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I think the above quote is truly intriguing mainly because in most of the centuries before our time art was the most transformative language especially during the Reniassance, but now we&apos;ve reached the point where it&apos;s not the creation of the abstract that is changing thought, but instead the creation of physical objects through engineering.</p>
<p><strong>4. Important Thing</strong>: Our engineered communication is mostly private, but it has always been like this before engineered communication. For example during the enlightment period, there were secret socities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Question:</strong> Why do we yearn for engineered and non-engineered communication to be private?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;The Critical Engineering Working Group&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot;The greater the dependance on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner workings&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I definitely experience the above quote on a daily. For example recently my laptop broke and I had to send it in to get fixed, therefore because we have become so dependent on technology we have specific places that know and understand the inner workings of technology. Without the knowledge of the inner working we wouldn&apos;t be able to fix nor develop it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Important Thing:</strong> &quot; written code expands into social and psychological realms, regulating behaviour between people and the machines they interact with&quot;</p>
<p><strong>5. Question:</strong> The article describes what the critical engineer considers, but how should we define the critical engineer?</p>






## Week 4

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;Pay for the Printer&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot; In this article Dawes and Fergesson clarify and personify a printer. They talk about it from a new perpective</p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot;The word isn't print the word is build. We're building tools, making things." He pulled out the crude wooden cup
    and laid it down on the ash." &quot;</p>
    <p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> The above quote reminds me of a class I took called, "Book History, Arts and Culture," and how we think of word as print, but there's so much more to it.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Important Thing:</strong> &quot;I think it's important to distinguish and define what is print and what is not&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>5. Question:</strong> The article personifies a printer, but what other devices could they personify to see from a new perspective?</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;The Preserving Machine &quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot; In this article he expressed his worry for the potential loss of music and delicate sound while paying tribute to it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot;Music is the most perishable of things, fragile and delicate and easily destroyed." &quot;</p>
    <p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I am really starting to see a reoccuring overlap between this class and my Music: Sound with Impact Class and I am thinking my final project will somewhat be related to music.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Important Thing:</strong> &quot;This reading is such an engima because as stated the method Doc preserves music also erases its value&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>5. Question:</strong> How do we preserve music without erasing its meaning?</p>

### Experiments

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PLATT EXPERIMENTS</strong></p>
#6

<p>Information I Learned:</p>
<p>-Some switches only have two terminals</p>
<p>- Sparking can erode the switch and make the connection not as reliable </p>
<p>- Schematics don't just tell you where to put components. They also tell you how to put them together.</p>
<p>- Although the switchs have two parts they are made up of one component. </p>
<p>- Electronic devices with metal chassis that connects to pins are grounded. </p>
<p>- Resistors only have two variants: The US and European variants. </p>
<p>-The Potentiometer symbols identify the wiper in the potentiometer </p>
<p>-There a 3 types of push buttons: normal pushbuttom (momentary switch)- where pressure closes the circuit and releasing opens the circuit."
<p>-Crossovers are used when wires must pass over each other without creating an electrical circuit </p>

## Week 5

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;Everything Thatâ€™s Inside Your iPhone&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot; In this article Merchant dives deeper than the foundational
elements and into actual elements. </p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot; "I aimed to trace the device to its deepest roots. And that meant trying to glean what the iPhone was actually composed of at its most foundational levels." &quot;</p>
    <p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> In this class and any other computer science class that I have taken, I always think about the computing break down, but this really helped me understand the physical computing breakdown of an everyday device from the perspective of an element. I also think its funny how a company
like Apple exists in Silicon Valley, but only includes about 6.31% of silicon in their products/</p>
    <p><strong>4. Important Thing:</strong> &quot;I think this article has been the best yet to provide a better perspective of the 
    physical computing side of elements.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>5. Question:</strong> I am interested to see the element breakdown of a Samsung vs IPhone?</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;One Man's Nearly Impossible Quest to Make a Toaster From Scratch &quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot; In this article he expressed his worry for the potential loss of music and delicate sound while paying tribute to it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot;"The smaller the scale you want to work on," explained Thwaites in his 2010 TED talk, "the further back in time you have to go." &quot;</p>
    <p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I found it interesting that they say plastic is the defining feature
    of cheap electronic goods because I would usually associate a certain metal as a defining feature not plastic.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Important Thing:</strong> &quot;I think its really important to emphasize that products like microwaves and iphones breakdown into various elements whereas when viewing by eye we might think otherwise&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>5. Question:</strong> What are ways we can break down electronics when we are limited to the expensive resources they have in these readings?</p>

#PLATT EXPERIMENTS!
<p>Materials:</p>
<p>Heat Gun, Low-Power Soldering Iron, Power Supply with an output of AC or DC, Solder, Copper Aligator Clips</p>

<p>In this experiment we worked as a class!</p>

<p>Information I Learned from Soldering:</p>
<p>-If the solder melts slowly during this experiment then the iron is not hot enough</p>
<p>-Soldering irons are not dangerous</p>
<p>-Avoid dirt and grease when soldering</p>
<p>-Large contact between the iton and working surfaces increase heat transfer</p>

<p>Materials:</p>
<p>9V battery and connector, Long-nosed pilers, 30 watt soldering iron, 12-watt soldering iron, LEDS, 470-ohm-resistor, copper aligator clips</p>

<p>Information I Learned from blowing an LED:</p>
<p>-The heat travels from the tip of the soldering iron into the wire that is connected to the LED and then into the aligator clips</p>
<p>-The aligator clips function as a heat sink</p>
<p>-Full sized copper alligator clips work best for this experiement</p>
<p>-There must be a metal to metal connection</p>

## Week 6

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;Igloo White&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot; In this article it dives deep into the use sensors in the miltary. </p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot; "The most widely used sensor for Igloo White was the air-delivered seismic detection sensor, which detected ground vibrations caused by enemy troops or vehicles. It was a small light, appearing much like the surrounding foilage" &quot;</p>
    <p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I thought this article was very interesting in a sense of showing how sensors play a part /</p>
    <p><strong>4. Important Thing:</strong> &quot;I think this article has been the best yet to provide a better perspective of the use of sensors in the military. I feel like things like this are usually very secretive. 
    physical computing side of elements.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>5. Question:</strong> What is the point of no return for sensors in the miltary?</p>
    
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;Unseen Sensors: Constantly Sensing but Rarely Seen &quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot; In this article he talks about the invisble sensors of the world to make his readers more aware of how present sensors are in our lives.</p>

<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot;"For all their ubiquity, the aesthetics of these public objects are generally unconsidered, and their function and provenance are ebtirely inscrutable." &quot;</p>
    <p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I this article very relatable because I often feel intrigued about the ambiguity of our technology.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Important Thing:</strong> &quot;"While the actual sensors may remain unchanged when policies and technologies shift, that which is qualiatively "sensed" changes dramatically as the systems analyzing data are installed, integrated, and upgraded. &quot;</p>
    <p><strong>5. Question:</strong> To what extent should sesnors be ambiguious without crossing the line?</p>

<p>Materials I would need:<br>
-Female-to-female jumper wires<br>
-PIR motion detector module</p>

<p>Notes:<br>
-PIR stands for passive infrared<br>
- The goal is to trigger action once motion is detected<br>

<p>Notes:<br>
-a program using sys.stdin.read function can be run from ssh session<br>
-an alternative approach is to use Pygame. Pygame which is a library for writing games<br>
-when using the Pygame approach, other keys have constant values, this allows the use of the cursor and other non-ASCII keys which is not possible using the other approach<br>

<p>Experiment </p>

<p>Notes:<br>
-the goal is to detect mouse movements in python<br>
-uses a similar solution to pygame to intercept mouse movements<br>
-mouse motion event gets triggered when the mouse moves within the Pygame window. <br>
-coordinates can be found from the pos value of the event and are absolute coordinates relative to the top-left corner of the window<br>

<p>Experiment</p>
-
<p>Materials I would need:<br>
-A DS1307 or compatible RTC module or an aLaMode board<br>
-Female-to-female jumper wires</p>

<p>Notes:<br>
-the RTC module must be 3.3V compatible (I2C interface should either have no pull-up resistors at all or should pull up to 3.3V... not 5V)<br>
-for the Adafruit model do not use the two resistors when soldering together the module<br>
-your Raspberry Pi must be set up to work with I2C<br>
-when using the original Raspberry Pi model B, revision 1, boards, then use 0 after the y option. <br>
-to set the time on the RTC module, your Raspberry Pi should have the right time.. it can also be set manually<br>
-might not always be using the Pi when connected to a network therefore RTC is a good option<br>
-Due to my pi being already set up for my final project I watched this youtube video as a replacement for the experiment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyvoOEO-Ncg</p>

<p>Steps:<br>
1. Assemble the RTC module: pull-up resistors and connect the module to the Raspberry Pi<br>
2. Run the program: hwclock<br>
3. Check that raspberry Pi has the right time<br>
4. Edit /etc/modules (using sudo nano /etc/modules) and add rtc-ds1307 to the end of the list of modules. <br>
5. Edit the file /etc/rc.local using the command sudo nano /etc/rc.local, and just before the final exit 0 line, add these lines</p>

<p></p>
<p>Experiment</p>

<p>Materials I would need:<br>
-10k&#937; trimpot <br>
-Two 1k&#937; resistors<br>
-220 nF capacitor</p>

<p>Notes:<br>
- the reading of the output will vary between 10 and 170 as the knob of the trimpot rotates<br>
-the way of doing things is called step response because it works by seeing how the circuit<br>
responds from the step change when an output is switched from low to high<br>
-the voltage can't be measured directly because the Raspberry Pi doesn&rsquo;t have an ADC converter<br>
-the speed at which the capacitor fills with charge depends on the value of the variable resistor<br>
-using a step response works well with all kinds of resistive sensors for light <br>
-Due to my pi being already set up for my final project I watched this youtube video as a replacement for the experiment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREOsIXPoLY</p>

<p>Experiment</p>

<p>Materials I would need:<br>
-Breadboard and jumper wires <br>
-Photoresistor<br>
-Two 1k&#937; resistors<br>
-220 nF capacitor</p>

<p>Notes:<br>
- the goal is to measure light intensity<br>
-use the same program pot_step.py<br>
-photoresistor is a resistor whose resistance varies depending on the amount of light coming through its transparent window.<br>
-The brighter the light, the lower the resistance.<br>

<p>Experiment</p>

<p>Materials:</p>
<p>-Breadboard and jumper wires&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Methane sensor&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Two 1k&Omega; resistors&nbsp;</p>
<p>-220 nF capacitor&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>-the sensor contains a heating element that requires 5V at up to 150 mA&nbsp;</p>
<p>-the connections are to the six sensor pins, not the four pins of the breakout&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Both the heater and the sensing surface are electrically just resistors</p>
<p>-Both can be connected either way&nbsp;</p>
