##Currently super behind on my experiments, but will have the documentation up soon


## Week 1 


### Context

<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;<strong>The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World</strong></p>
<p>1.<strong>&nbsp;Summary:</strong> The Internet of Things discussed the architecture of our society's dependency on the internet. .</p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong>&quot;The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it&apos;s not really yours&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Important Thing:</strong> &quot;There are no clear and agreed-upon architectures for building connected systems.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>4. &nbsp;Comment:</strong> I didn&apos;t really think about how different architectures can effect the systems</p>
<p><strong>5. Question:</strong> What are the essential elements for creating a test bed?</p>
<p><br></p>

## Week 2

<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> In the article the main topic is our dependency on technology. Examples such as alarm systems, dog doors and many more are given in the question of what would we do if the WiFi no longer existed. Therefore the article suggests that we must create aiding technology that supports us, but also that we are not completely dependent on</p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:&nbsp;</strong>&quot;Well, for one, it means things are less reliable. More than once i&apos;ve come home to an icy house because the internet had gone down, then spent hours trying to fix it only to have the thermostat jammed on 86 degrees until tech support reset my account. My old devices were so dumb, but in hindsight, that was kind of charming. They didn&apos;t do much, and perhaps that simplicity is really what we need.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I sometimes think about this and how reliable we are on technology. I think this can also be expanded to beyond technology. This weekend my mom and I had a discussion on how reliant we are to having fully stocked grocceries and gas supply. How we as humans are completely dependent on something else more than we are dependent on ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>4. Question:&nbsp;</strong>How do we create evolving devices that we can still benefit from, but are not completely dependent on? How does these ideas expand into crypto currency?</p>
<p><strong>5. Summarize:</strong> When creating new devices the 2 articles suggest that we need to be more precaution when constructing around reliability. More specifically we need to make sure there is agreement between systems. As well as its important to develop systems to reflect architectural choices. Lastly, we should create a test bed to make sure we are not too reliable on these new product.</p>


### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->

Text, photos, etc. 
    2. 
    3. I re-sparked my ability to use circuts. 
    4. Write a quiz question (which we will discuss in class) Coming soon...

## Week 3

<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;<strong>"Artist Profile: Julian Oliver"</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot;</p> "This discusses the secretive reputation of the internet </p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot;Engineering, not Art, is the most, is the most transformative language.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I think the above quote is truly intriguing mainly because in most of the centuries before our time art was the most transformative language especially during the Reniassance, but now we&apos;ve reached the point where it&apos;s not the creation of the abstract that is changing thought, but instead the creation of physical objects through engineering.</p>
<p><strong>4. Important Thing</strong>: Our engineered communication is mostly private, but it has always been like this before engineered communication. For example during the enlightment period, there were secret socities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Question:</strong> Why do we yearn for engineered and non-engineered communication to be private?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;The Critical Engineering Working Group&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Summary:</strong> &quot;&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2. Quote:</strong> &quot;The greater the dependance on a technology the greater the need to study and expose its inner workings&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3. Comment:</strong> I definitely experience the above quote on a daily. For example recently my laptop broke and I had to send it in to get fixed, therefore because we have become so dependent on technology we have specific places that know and understand the inner workings of technology. Without the knowledge of the inner working we wouldn&apos;t be able to fix nor develop it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Important Thing:</strong> &quot;written code expands into social and psychological realms, regulating behaviour between people and the machines they interact with&quot;</p>
<p><strong>5. Question:</strong> The article describes what the critical engineer considers, but how should we define the critical engineer?</p>
