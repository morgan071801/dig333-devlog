## Week 1

### Context

- Summarize the article(s) in 3-4 sentences. Also include...
- 1 quote from the reading(s)
- 1 related comment on the reading(s)
- 1 related follow-up question (what question does it bring up for you?)
- "The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World
- Quote:
- Important Thing: "There are no clear and agreed-upon architectures for building connected systems."
- Comment: I didn't really think about how different architectures
- can effect the systems
- Question: What are the essential elements for creating a test bed?
- "The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours"
- Quote: "Well, for one, it means things are less reliable. More than once
- i've come home to an icy house because the internet had gone down, then spent hours trying to fix it only to have the thermostat jammed on 86 degrees until tech
- support reset my account."
- "My old devices were so dumb, but in hindsight, that was kind of charming.
- They didn't do much, and perhaps that simplicity is really what we need."
- Comment: I sometime think about this and how reliable we are on technology
- I think this can also be expanded to beyond technology. This weekend
- my mom and I had a discussion on how reliant we are to having fully 
- stocked grocceries and gas supply. How we as humans are completely dependent
- on something else more than we are dependent on ourselves.
- Question: How do we create evoling devices that we can still benefit
- from, but are not completely dependent on.
- How does these ideas expand to crypto currency?
- Summarize: When creating new devices the 2 artciles suggest that we need to be more
- precaution when constructing around reliability. More specifically
- we need to make sure there is agreemenent between systems. As well as
- its important to develop systems to reflect architectural choices. Lastly,
- we should create a test bed to make sure we are not too reliable on 
- these new product.
